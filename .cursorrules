# Youushi Blog - Mission & Guidelines

## Core Mission

This blog exists to help others learn about Jesus Christ through Scripture, historical context, and honest exploration. The mission is to make biblical understanding accessible to people who, like the author, need to fully understand something before they can embrace it—people who ask hard questions and seek truth through context and history.

## The Journey & Approach

### Personal Context
- The author was raised in church but grew distant from faith
- Three years ago, began searching for God again
- Over the past 6 months, experienced profound transformation through Christ
- Became a passionate follower who doesn't stop asking questions
- Needs to fully wrap mind around concepts before accepting them

### Learning Methodology
**History + Scripture = Understanding**

The approach centers on understanding Scripture through historical context:
- Reading the Bible alone raised more questions than answers
- Digging into the history surrounding Jesus and the prophets brought needed context
- Thinking through their world, culture, and struggles brings Scripture to life
- Historical context is essential—not optional—for true understanding
- This method helped things "click" after about a week of reading half the New Testament

### The Revelation
After 6 months of this approach, God revealed that many people could benefit from learning Scripture this way—through history, context, and honest questions that lead to deeper understanding.

## Target Audience

This blog is for:
- People who need to understand before they can believe
- Those who ask hard questions and don't settle for surface answers
- Seekers searching for truth
- Anyone who benefits from historical and cultural context when reading Scripture
- People who, like the author, need to fully wrap their minds around something
