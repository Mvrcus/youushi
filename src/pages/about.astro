	<p>
		Three years ago, I started searching for God again. I'd grown distant from the faith I knew as a child, 
		but something was pulling me back. I didn't know what it was, but I knew I had to find it.
	</p>
	<p>
		What I found was more than I ever imagined. Over the past six months, God has transformed my life in 
		ways that still leave me in awe. I've become a passionate follower of Christ - but I'm also still me. 
		I'm still the person who needs to fully understand something before I can embrace it. I still don't 
		stop asking questions until I've wrapped my mind around the truth. And that's okay. More than okay - it's 
		how God made me.
	</p>

	<h2>When Questions Lead to Discovery</h2>
	<p>
		Six months ago, I opened the Bible for the first time in years. I was desperate to hear what God had 
		to say to me, but I didn't know how to listen. So I did the only thing I could think of: I started 
		reading His Word, hoping I'd recognize His voice when I heard it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of answers, I got questions. More questions than I knew what to do with. Every passage raised 
		something new. Every verse made me wonder: What did this mean to them? What was their world like? 
		Why did they write this? What were they struggling with?
	</p>
	<p>
		That's when I started digging into the history. I began reading about the world Jesus walked in. I 
		studied the culture of the prophets. I thought through their struggles, their context, their reality. 
		And something incredible happened: the words came alive.
	</p>
	<p>
		About a week in, after reading through roughly half of the New Testament, things started to click. 
		Not all at once - but piece by piece. The questions started finding their answers. The context brought 
		clarity. The history brought understanding. And understanding brought transformation.
	</p>

	<h2>The Revelation</h2>
	<p>
		Now, six months later, I'm searching for ways to use the gifts God has given me to spread the message 
		of Jesus - the Messiah, Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
	</p>
	<p>
		And He revealed something to me: there are others like me. Others who need to understand before they 
		can believe. Others who ask hard questions and won't settle for surface answers. Others who are searching 
		for truth, honestly searching, and who could benefit from learning Scripture the way I'm learning it - through 
		history, through context, through honest questions that lead to deeper understanding.
	</p>
	<p>
		This blog is my way of sharing that journey. It's my way of saying: you're not alone in your questions. 
		You're not wrong for needing to understand. And there's a way forward - a way that honors both your 
		intellect and your faith, a way that doesn't ask you to check your brain at the door.
	</p>

	<h2>How We Explore</h2>
	<p>
		Here, we don't shy away from difficult questions. We don't settle for easy answers. We dig deep. We 
		think critically. We trust that God's Word is strong enough to handle our honest inquiry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because when we understand the world in which Scripture was written - when we see the culture, feel the 
		history, understand the struggles - the words don't just inform us. They transform us. They speak to our 
		minds and our hearts. They answer our questions and deepen our faith.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're someone who needs to understand before you can believe, if you're someone who asks hard 
		questions, if you're searching for truth - this is for you. You're joining us. And we're saying hello.
