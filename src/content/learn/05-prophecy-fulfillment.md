Prophecy isn’t a party trick. It’s a thread.

One of the most compelling things about Scripture is how **themes and promises** develop over centuries - then converge in Christ.

This section is where we’ll build a library of:

- what the prophecy says (in context)
- what the world looked like when it was given
- how it’s later referenced
- where fulfillment is claimed (and why)

Slow, careful, and honest.
