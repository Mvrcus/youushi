I used to read the Bible and walk away with **more questions than answers**. Not because Scripture is unclear - but because *I was missing the world it came from*.

When you step into the history, the culture, and the reality of the people who first heard these words, something changes:

- The stories stop feeling random.
- The commands stop feeling disconnected.
- The teachings of Jesus start landing with weight.

This is the heartbeat of YouUsHi:

> **History + Scripture = Understanding**

Not to make the Bible “fit” modern ideas -  
but to hear it the way it was first spoken, so we can receive it the way God intended.
