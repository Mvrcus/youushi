When people say “Islam and Christianity are basically the same,” they usually mean **both talk about God**.

But the differences aren’t small. They’re structural:

- **Who is Jesus?** (prophet vs Lord / Son)
- **What is Scripture?** (Qur’an as final revelation vs OT/NT as inspired testimony)
- **What is the problem and solution?** (sin/holiness/atonement vs submission/law/mercy)

The point of this section is not to caricature Muslims.  
It’s to understand what each faith actually teaches and then ask: **Which story is true?**
