Not every difference is the same kind of difference.

Some differences are **family-level** (how churches structure leadership, worship style, secondary doctrines).

Some differences touch the **center** (who Jesus is, what the gospel is, how salvation works).

This section will build a simple map:

- **What all historic Christianity holds in common** (think creeds / core claims)
- **Where Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants differ** (and why)
- **How to approach groups like Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormonism** with clarity and respect

The goal isn’t tribalism.  
The goal is to know what you believe, why you believe it, and how to speak truth without arrogance.
