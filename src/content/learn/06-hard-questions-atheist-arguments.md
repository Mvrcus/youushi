Some questions don’t go away just because you want to believe.

This is where we collect common objections like:

- “The Bible was changed.”
- “Faith is irrational.”
- “Why would a good God allow suffering?”
- “Aren’t there contradictions?”

The goal isn’t to “win.”  
The goal is to **think honestly**, and to show that Christianity doesn’t require you to shut your brain off.
