If you’ve ever felt tension between the Old Testament and Jesus, you’re not crazy.

But here’s what changed things for me:

**The Old Testament isn’t a different God. It’s the same God writing the first chapters.**

When you trace themes like:

- sacrifice
- covenant
- priesthood
- holiness
- justice and mercy

…you start to see why Jesus is called the **Lamb**, the **High Priest**, the **Messiah**, and the **King**.

This isn’t a contradiction story.  
It’s a fulfillment story.
