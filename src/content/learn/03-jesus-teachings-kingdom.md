Jesus doesn’t just give rules. He exposes the heart.

He talks about:

- love that blesses enemies
- righteousness that isn’t a performance
- prayer that isn’t a show
- treasure that can’t be stolen

And He says the kind of people God calls “blessed” look nothing like what the world rewards.

If you’ve ever felt like Christianity was just a list of behaviors - this is where that starts to break.
