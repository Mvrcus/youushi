If you strip away religious noise, the gospel is simple - and it’s weighty.

**God is holy.** We are not.  
**Sin is real.** It separates.  
**Jesus is not an accessory.** He is the rescue.

The gospel is the announcement that **Jesus Christ came**, **died**, and **rose again** - and that through Him, forgiveness and new life are offered as a gift.

This is not “be good and maybe God accepts you.”  
This is **God coming to you** when you couldn’t climb your way back.

If you’re here because you want truth - not vibes - welcome. We’re going to keep it honest and grounded in Scripture.
