One of the best ways to understand a religion is to ask:

**What is the problem?**  
**What is the solution?**  
**And what does it say is ultimately real?**

For Buddhism (broadly speaking), the problem is often framed around **suffering** and the way craving/attachment traps us.

Christianity speaks about suffering too - but it diagnoses something deeper:

- not just pain
- not just desire
- but **sin** and separation from God

This section will grow into a careful comparison that doesn’t mock anyone - just tries to be honest about the claims.
