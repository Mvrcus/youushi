If we’re going to talk about other religions (or different Christian groups), we have to do it with honesty.

Here’s the simple framework I’m using on YouUsHi:

- **Define terms** (What do they mean by “God,” “Scripture,” “salvation,” “prophet,” “sin”?)
- **Use primary sources** (what they actually say, not what opponents say)
- **Compare core claims** (not surface-level similarities)
- **Ask the question underneath the question**: *What kind of reality does this belief system describe?*

The goal isn’t to dunk on people.  
The goal is to **seek truth** and to make sure we’re not building our faith on misunderstanding.
