Jesus wasn’t dropped into a blank world. He was born into a story already in progress.

To understand the New Testament, we’ll keep returning to:

- **Covenant** (what God promised and what Israel carried)
- **Temple / sacrifice** (how sin and holiness were understood)
- **Messiah expectations** (what people thought “Messiah” would mean)
- **The world of Second Temple Judaism** (Rome, sects, tensions, hopes)

This isn’t “Christianity vs Judaism” as a debate topic.  
This is **understanding the roots** so we can read Jesus with clarity.
